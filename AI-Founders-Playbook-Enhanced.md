## Key Philosophy

This guide is built on one core belief:

**Your constraints are your strength.**

Not your weakness.

Here's why: Constraints force you to:
- Build simple solutions (not overengineered products)
- Focus on the biggest pain points (not nice-to-haves)
- Move faster (not slower)
- Spend less (not more)

The worst AI ventures are unlimited budgets building the wrong product.

The best AI ventures are limited founders solving a specific problem for specific people.

---

# <a name="chapter-1"></a>Chapter 1: Know Your Limits (Before You Fail)

## The Core Idea

Before you write a single line of code, you need to know three things:

1. **How much time do you have?** (Time Capacity)
2. **How much money do you have?** (Money Capacity)
3. **What can you actually build?** (Skill Capacity)

If you get these wrong, you'll build the wrong product, or run out of money/time before launching.

---

## Step 1: Calculate Your Time Capacity

**Question:** How many hours per week can you dedicate to this?

Be honest. If you have a job, it's probably 10-20 hours/week.

**Write it down:**

```
My time capacity: _____ hours per week
```

**Why it matters:** A founder with 20 hours/week can't build a complex ML model from scratch. They CAN leverage existing APIs or simple solutions.

---

## Step 2: Calculate Your Money Capacity

**Question:** How much money can you afford to lose?

This might be:
- Personal savings: $5K, $10K, $50K?
- Friends and family: $50K-$200K?
- Seed funding: $100K-$500K?

**Write it down:**

```
My money capacity: $___________
Reserve for personal living (6 months): $_________
Available for the venture: $_________
```

**Why it matters:** If you have $5K, you're buying existing services (Google APIs, Stripe, etc.). If you have $200K, you can hire people and build custom solutions.

---

## Step 3: Assess Your Skill Capacity

**Question:** What can you actually build RIGHT NOW?

Rate yourself 1-5 for each:

```
Python/Code: _____ (1=never coded, 5=senior engineer)
AI/ML Concepts: _____ (1=never heard of ML, 5=trained models)
Business/Sales: _____ (1=no experience, 5=sold successfully)
Data Work: _____ (1=no experience, 5=built data pipelines)
```

**Why it matters:** Your skills determine what's realistic. A great salesperson + basic coder is a better combination than an expert ML engineer with no business sense.

---

## Step 4: Define Your Realistic Goal

**Question:** What does "success" look like in the next 12 months?

Examples:
- $5K/month recurring revenue (MRR)
- 100 paying customers
- Prove the concept works (then raise money)
- Get acquired by a bigger company

**Write it down:**

```
My 12-month goal: _________________________________
```

**Why it matters:** Your goal shapes every decision. If you want $100K MRR, you need a different strategy than if you want to prove the concept works.

---

## The Constraint-Adjusted Goal Formula

Here's the formula that ties it together:

**Time to Market Success = Total Hours Needed / Time Capacity per Week**

Example:
- You have 20 hours/week to work on this
- Building a basic MVP takes ~300 founder hours
- 300 hours / 20 hours per week = **15 weeks to MVP**

This tells you if your goal is realistic.

---

## Common Failure Modes + How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | What Happens | How to Fix It |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Ignoring time constraints | You burn out, project dies | Be ruthlessly honest about available hours |
| Overestimating skill | You pick projects too hard | Start with something 20% harder than you can do |
| Underestimating cost | You run out of money mid-build | Add 50% buffer to all estimates |
| No clear goal | You meander forever | Define ONE clear metric for success |

---

## Mastery Challenge: Your Capacity Document

**Create a 1-page document with:**

1. Time capacity: _____ hours/week
2. Money capacity: $_____
3. Your 3 biggest skills: ________________
4. Your 12-month goal: ________________
5. Time to MVP (using formula): _____ weeks

This is your foundation. Keep it visible. Reference it constantly.

---

# <a name="chapter-2"></a>Chapter 2: Find the Real Problem

## The Core Idea

Most founders solve problems they think are important.

Real founders solve problems people will PAY to solve.

This chapter teaches you how to find (and verify) the real problems worth solving.

---

## The Three-Question Test

Before you spend 1 hour on this idea, ask:

**Question 1: Is someone already spending money to solve this?**

If YES: The problem exists. People have budgets for it.
If NO: Either the problem doesn't matter OR nobody knows the solution yet.

**Question 2: How often does the problem happen?**

If daily/weekly: Fast feedback loop. You can validate quickly.
If monthly/yearly: Slow feedback. You need many customers to iterate.

**Question 3: What happens if the problem doesn't get solved?**

If "annoying": Not urgent. People live with it.
If "costs money/time": Urgent. People want solutions.

---

## Calculate the Cost of the Problem

**The Formula:**

```
Cost = Hours Lost per Week × Weekly Hourly Rate × 50 weeks/year

Example:
- Lawyer spends 10 hours/week on manual document review
- Their hourly rate: $200/hour
- Annual cost = 10 hours × $200 × 50 = $100,000/year
```

This number is critical. It tells you:
1. If the problem is big enough to solve
2. How much customers could afford to pay

**Calculate for your problem:**

```
Hours lost per week: _____
Hourly rate of the person suffering: $_____
Annual cost (problem × $200 × 50): $_____
```

---

## The Red Flags: Problems NOT Worth Solving

| Red Flag | Example | Why It's Bad |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Vanity Pain** | "Wouldn't it be cool if..." but no budget for it | People think it's nice, not necessary |
| **One-Off Problems** | Happens once every 2 years | Too slow to get feedback, test, iterate |
| **Tooling Gap** | People aren't using existing tools right | Problem is training, not technology |
| **No Current Spend** | They solve it for free or ignore it | No proof anyone values the solution |

---

## How to Interview Customers (The Right Way)

**The Rule:** Never mention your idea until the customer fully describes the problem.

**Interview Script:**

```
1. "Tell me about the last time you had to [do the painful task]."
   (Listen. Take notes. Don't interrupt.)

2. "What did you do to solve it?"
   (Understand their current workaround.)

3. "How much time did that take you?"
   (Quantify the cost. Be specific.)

4. "Have you tried to buy a solution for this before?"
   (Understand if they've already invested money.)

5. "If I built something that solved this, what would be the biggest barrier to you using it?"
   (Understand real friction, not hypothetical objections.)
```

**Do NOT ask:**
- "Would you use a tool that did X?"
- "Don't you think it would be great if...?"
- "Is this a big problem for you?"

These questions let customers agree with you. You want truth, not agreement.

---

## The Commitment Test

After they describe the problem, ask:

**"If I had a solution ready next week, what would you need to do internally to start using it?"**

Listen for:
- Specific names of decision-makers
- Concrete next steps
- Real urgency

If they say "That sounds cool, send me something," they're not ready. If they say "I'd need to get budget approval from X by Friday," they are.

---

## Sample Problem: Lawyer Edition

Here's a real example:

**Problem:** Lawyers spend 10 hours/week manually reviewing deposition transcripts.

**Interview findings:**
- Q: "Tell me about the last time you did this?"
  A: "Yesterday. Spent 8 hours searching for key terms in a 500-page transcript."
  
- Q: "What did you do?"
  A: "Used Ctrl+F to search, then manually highlighted and summarized."
  
- Q: "How much time?"
  A: "About 8 hours. Plus I probably missed 5-10% of relevant data."
  
- Q: "Have you tried solutions?"
  A: "We looked at e-discovery platforms but they cost $100K+/year. Not worth it for this."

**Cost Calculation:**
- 8 hours × $250/hour (lawyer cost) = $2,000 per incident
- Happens 50 times per year = $100,000/year per lawyer

**Decision:** WORTH SOLVING. High cost. Clear workaround. Budget exists.

---

## Mastery Challenge: Interview 5 Customers

Go interview 5 people doing the painful job (not decision-makers yet):

For each interview:
1. Record the problem cost (hours × rate)
2. Note the current workaround
3. Identify who makes the budget decision
4. Rate commitment level (1-10)

Bring this data to Chapter 3.

---

# <a name="chapter-3"></a>Chapter 3: Generate 100 Ideas (But Filter Ruthlessly)

## The Core Idea

You have one validated problem. But 1000 ways to solve it.

Your job: Generate 100 different solutions, then pick the 10 that are actually feasible.

This filters out the expensive, complicated solutions early.

---

## Why Generate 100 Ideas?

**Myth:** The first idea is usually the best.

**Truth:** The first idea is usually the obvious, expensive, complex idea.

**Example:**

*Problem: Lawyers waste 8 hours searching transcripts.*

- First idea (obvious): "Build a full AI system that reads and understands all legal concepts"
- This needs: ML engineers ($150K/year), training data ($50K), servers ($5K/month), lawyers ($200K) = Not viable for a bootstrapped founder.

- Better ideas:
  - Use Google Document AI to extract entities (costs $500, not $50K)
  - Use regex rules to find dollar amounts and dates (costs $0, needs 40 hours)
  - Use ChatGPT API to summarize sections (costs $50, needs 20 hours)

Only by generating 100 ideas do you see the simple solutions.

---

## The Ideation Framework: SCAMPER Adapted for AI

Use these 6 lenses to brainstorm. Force yourself to generate ideas using EACH lens:

```
SUBSTITUTE: What can AI REPLACE in the workflow?
Example: Replace manual search → AI search

COMBINE: What two existing tools can AI connect?
Example: Connect CRM data + regulatory filings

ADAPT: What AI from another industry could work here?
Example: Use computer vision (from manufacturing) for document analysis

MODIFY: What can AI make faster/bigger/smaller?
Example: Increase review speed by 10x

ELIMINATE: What steps can AI remove entirely?
Example: Remove the need for human approval (if AI confidence > 95%)

MINIMIZE: What can AI simplify?
Example: Simplify data entry by auto-filling forms
```

---

## The Scoring System

You can't evaluate 100 ideas by hand. Use this simple score:

**For each idea, rate:**

1. **Skill Fit** (1-5 scale): Does this match your skills?
   - 5 = I can build this this week
   - 1 = I'd need to hire experts

2. **Data Availability** (1-5 scale): Can you get the data?
   - 5 = Data is public or you already have it
   - 1 = Data is proprietary/impossible to get

3. **Cost** (dollar estimate): How much would it cost to build?
   - Rule of thumb: Build = $10K+. Buy (API) = $500-$5K. Borrow (open-source) = $0-$2K

---

## The Formula

```
Feasibility Score = (Skill Fit × Data Availability) / (Cost)

Higher score = more feasible given your constraints
```

---

## Worked Example

**Problem:** Lawyer needs to review 500 transcripts/month.

**Idea 1: Build a Custom ML Model**
- Skill Fit: 2 (would need to hire ML engineer)
- Data Availability: 2 (need labeled legal data)
- Cost: $50,000+
- Score = (2 × 2) / 50,000 = **0.0001** (not viable)

**Idea 2: Use Google Document AI API**
- Skill Fit: 4 (can integrate APIs)
- Data Availability: 5 (already have transcripts)
- Cost: $500
- Score = (4 × 5) / 500 = **0.04** (much better!)

**Idea 3: Write Python Regex Rules**
- Skill Fit: 5 (can write regex)
- Data Availability: 5 (have transcripts)
- Cost: $100 (cloud server only)
- Score = (5 × 5) / 100 = **0.25** (best!)

Idea 3 scores highest despite being "less AI" because it's feasible for YOUR situation.

---

## The 100-Idea Sprint

**Time:** 4-6 hours (one afternoon)

**Process:**

1. Set timer for 20 minutes per SCAMPER lens
2. Write 20 ideas per lens (don't self-censor, quantity not quality)
3. After generating all 100, take a break
4. Return and score each idea using the formula above
5. Select top 10 ideas (highest scores)

**Template (Google Sheets):**

| ID | Idea | Lens | Skill (1-5) | Data (1-5) | Cost | Score |
|-----|------|------|-------------|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | Use regex to find dates | Eliminate | 5 | 5 | $100 | 0.25 |
| 2 | Connect to CRM + transcripts | Combine | 4 | 3 | $1K | 0.012 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Only generate "smart" ideas | Force yourself to include silly ones. Silly often reveals simple solutions. |
| Score while generating | Separate the two. Generate 100 first, score later. |
| Only 1-2 hours | Set 6 hours. Fatigue leads to creativity. |
| Ideas are too vague | Use the formula: "Verb + Specific Target + Metric" (e.g., "Use regex to find 95% of dates") |

---

## Mastery Challenge: Complete the 100-Idea Sprint

1. Spend 6 hours generating 100 ideas using SCAMPER
2. Score each idea
3. Bring your top 10 to Chapter 4

---

# <a name="chapter-4"></a>Chapter 4: Talk to Customers (The Right Way)

## The Core Idea

You have 10 ideas. But which one should you build?

This chapter teaches you how to test ideas by talking to customers—and filter out 8 of them ruthlessly.

---

## The Mistake Most Founders Make

They pitch their favorite idea.

Then they ask: "What do you think?"

The customer says: "That sounds cool!"

The founder thinks: "Great, I have validation!"

Then they spend 6 months building... and nobody buys.

---

## The Right Way: Test the Fatal Assumptions

For each idea, write down 3 assumptions that, if false, would kill the idea:

**Example (Lawyer AI):**

**Idea: Use Google Document AI to extract key entities from transcripts**

Fatal Assumptions:
1. "Lawyers are allowed to use external cloud tools (compliance permits it)"
2. "The cost of error is high enough that they'll pay to reduce it"
3. "We can access transcripts in the format we need"

If ANY of these is false, the idea doesn't work.

Now go test them.

---

## The Interview Script (That Actually Works)

Talk to 5-10 people actually doing the painful job. Use this script:

```
PART 1: UNDERSTAND THE PAIN (Don't mention your idea)

"Tell me about the last time you had to [do the painful task]."
"What happened? What did you do?"
"How much time did it take?"
"What was most frustrating?"

PART 2: TEST YOUR FATAL ASSUMPTIONS

(For Assumption 1: Compliance)
"Have you tried to use cloud-based tools for this work?"
"What compliance rules do you have to follow?"
"Have those ever blocked tools?"

(For Assumption 2: Cost of Error)
"What happens if you miss something?"
"How much does that error typically cost?"
"Would it be worth paying to reduce errors?"

(For Assumption 3: Data Access)
"How are the documents usually formatted/stored?"
"Can you easily export them?"
"What would need to happen to use a tool?"

PART 3: THE COMMITMENT TEST

"If we had this solution ready next month, what would be the biggest barrier to you using it?"
"Who specifically would need to approve it?"
"Can you introduce me to that person?"
```

---

## The Scoring System

After each interview, score:

**Pain Verification (0-3):** Did they confirm this is a real, expensive problem?
- 3 = Yes, they calculated the cost
- 0 = They don't think it's a big deal

**Budget Confirmation (0-5):** Do they have money allocated for solutions?
- 5 = Yes, and it's easy to approve
- 0 = No budget, or approval would take months

**Commitment Signal (0-10):** Are they willing to take action?
- 10 = Agreed to pilot, or introduced me to decision-maker
- 0 = "That sounds cool, send me something"

**Validation Score = (PV × 1) + (BC × 1.5) + (CS × 2)**

(Higher commitment weighted most, because commitment > compliments)

---

## What Kills Ideas

If an idea has:
- Average PV < 1: Problem isn't real enough
- Average BC < 2: No budget/approval authority
- Average CS < 3: No one willing to commit

**Kill the idea.** Move to the next one.

---

## The "Commitment Test" Explained

The magic question:

**"If I had this ready next week, what's the biggest barrier to you using it?"**

Listen for:
- **Strong signal:** "I'd need to show it to our CTO by Friday"
- **Weak signal:** "That sounds interesting, send me a demo"

Strong signal = they'll act.
Weak signal = they like the idea in theory, won't use it in practice.

---

## Sample Results: Lawyer Edition

You test 10 people on your top 3 ideas:

**Idea A: Custom ML Model**
- PV: 1.5 (they confirm pain, but not as bad as expected)
- BC: 0.5 (no budget approval authority)
- CS: 1 (no commitment)
- **Validation Score: 2.5** ← KILL

**Idea B: Google Document AI**
- PV: 2.5 (confirm pain)
- BC: 3.5 (have budget for tools)
- CS: 5 (2 people willing to pilot)
- **Validation Score: 18.5** ← PURSUE

**Idea C: Regex Rules**
- PV: 2.8 (confirm pain)
- BC: 3.8 (have budget)
- CS: 7 (5 willing to pilot, one wants to introduce decision-maker)
- **Validation Score: 24.5** ← STRONG

---

## Mastery Challenge: Interview 10 Customers

Interview 10 people across your top 3 ideas:

For each interview:
1. Test the 3 fatal assumptions
2. Score PV, BC, CS
3. Calculate Validation Score

Which idea has the highest average Validation Score?

That's the one to build.

---

# <a name="chapter-5"></a>Chapter 5: Build a Fake Product First

## The Core Idea

Before writing code, create a landing page that looks real.

See if people will actually commit to paying/using it.

If they won't click the "Buy Now" button, don't build it.

---

## Why a Fake Product?

**Real situation:**

A founder spends 3 months building an app. They launch. Nobody uses it.

**With a fake product:**

They spend 2 hours creating a landing page. They drive 500 visitors to it. 3 click "Buy." They realize the idea doesn't work. Total loss: 2 hours.

Which is better?

---

## The Landing Page Template

Create a simple one-page site with:

```
HEADLINE
Stop wasting 8 hours every week on manual transcript review

SUBHEADLINE
AI that finds key information in seconds—so you can focus on strategy.

PROBLEM (Social Proof)
✓ 10 hours/week wasted on manual review
✓ 5-10% of critical data gets missed
✓ No existing tool fits your compliance needs

SOLUTION
Our AI extracts names, dates, amounts, and contracts in seconds.
No complex setup. Works with your current documents.

CTA BUTTON
Start 7-Day Paid Pilot ($49.99)
↓

TESTIMONIALS (Use realistic quotes from your 10 interviews)
"We used to spend 8 hours a week on this. Now it's 1 hour."
— Sarah Chen, Litigation Partner

REFUND POLICY
Not satisfied? Full refund in 7 days. No questions asked.
```

---

## Build It Quickly (2 Hours Max)

Use these tools:

- **Carrd** ($19/year): Dead simple landing page builder
- **Webflow** (free trial): If you want fancier design
- **Figma**: Just design a mockup (don't build yet)

---

## Test It With Your Committed Customers

Send the link to the 5 people who said they'd pilot.

Ask: "Would you click the 'Start Pilot' button?"

Track:
- How many visited: _____
- How many clicked "Start Pilot": _____
- Of those, how many actually entered payment info: _____

**The metric that matters:** How many went past the "Pay Now" step?

If only 1 of 5 of your "committed" customers clicks, the idea isn't real to them yet.

---

## What This Tells You

- **50%+ click the button:** Strong signal. Build it.
- **20-50% click:** Moderate signal. Refine and re-test.
- **<20% click:** Weak signal. Kill the idea or pivot hard.

---

## Mastery Challenge: Build and Test

1. Build a landing page for your winning idea (2 hours, use Carrd)
2. Drive 100 visitors to it (LinkedIn posts, email, forums)
3. Track clicks and conversions
4. If >20% of your committed customers click "Buy," proceed to Chapter 6

---

# <a name="chapter-6"></a>Chapter 6: Define Your MVP

## The Core Idea

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the smallest thing you can build that proves your idea works.

Most founders build too much.

This chapter teaches you what to build and what to cut.

---

## The MVP Question

Ask yourself: "What's the ONE thing I need to prove works?"

**Example (Lawyer AI):**

- ❌ NOT: "Build a full document management system"
- ❌ NOT: "Create 99% accurate extraction"
- ✅ YES: "Extract names, dates, amounts with 90% accuracy in under 1 minute per document"

See the difference? You're proving ONE thing: Can we extract key entities fast?

---

## The Three-Layer Rule

Every software product has three layers:

```
PRESENTATION LAYER (What users see)
↓
APPLICATION LAYER (Your logic: the AI model, rules, etc.)
↓
DATA LAYER (Where you store data)
```

For an MVP, you need all three, but keep each layer simple:

**Presentation:** A simple upload form. That's it. No fancy UI.

**Application:** Use existing tools (APIs, libraries) don't build from scratch.

**Data:** Simple database or even files. Don't over-architect.

---

## The Build/Buy/Borrow Decision

For your AI component, you have 3 options:

**1. BUILD (Custom Model)**
- Cost: $10K+
- Time: Months
- Skill: High (need ML engineer)
- Best for: Proprietary data/logic competitors can't copy

**2. BUY (Commercial API)**
- Cost: $500-$5K
- Time: Days
- Skill: Medium (need API integration)
- Best for: Standard tasks (classification, extraction, summarization)

**3. BORROW (Open-Source)**
- Cost: $0-$2K
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Skill: Medium-High (need deployment knowledge)
- Best for: Flexibility + control, low budget

---

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Build | Buy | Borrow |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Speed | Slow | Fast | Medium |
| Cost | Expensive | Medium | Cheap |
| Control | Full | Limited | Full |
| Skill Needed | Very High | Medium | High |
| Best for MVP? | No | Yes | Maybe |

**For MVP: Usually BUY**. It's fast, proven, and doesn't require ML expertise.

---

## Cost Estimate Template

For your winning idea, calculate 3-month costs:

```
MONTH 1-3 COSTS

IF YOU BUY (Google API):
- API calls: 5,000 documents × $0.05 = $250/month × 3 = $750
- Server hosting: $50/month × 3 = $150
- Domain + tools: $30
Total: $930

IF YOU BORROW (Open-source model):
- Setup/deployment: $500 (one-time)
- Server hosting: $100/month × 3 = $300
- Your time: 100 hours setup
Total: $800 + your time

IF YOU BUILD (Custom):
- ML engineer: $150K/year, so $37.5K for 3 months
- Data annotation: $5K
- Infrastructure: $1K
Total: $43.5K

DECISION: BUY (Google API) = $930 total. Fast, cheap, proven.
```

---

## The MVP Success Metric

Define ONE metric that proves your idea works. Examples:

- "Extract 95% of entities correctly"
- "Reduce review time from 8 hours to 1 hour"
- "Get 10 paying customers in 30 days"
- "Achieve 90% user satisfaction"

Pick the ONE most critical metric.

---

## Mastery Challenge: Define Your MVP

Create a 1-page MVP Brief:

1. **One-sentence description:** What does this do?
2. **Success metric:** How do you know it works?
3. **Build/Buy/Borrow decision:** Which path for your AI component?
4. **3-month cost estimate:** How much will it cost?
5. **Timeline:** When can you launch?

---

# <a name="chapter-7"></a>Chapter 7: Pick Your AI Model

## The Core Idea

AI isn't one thing. It's a spectrum:

```
Simple (Left) ← → Complex (Right)

Rules-Based (IF/THEN statements)
↓
Classification (Pre-trained models: "Is this spam?")
↓
Extraction (Google APIs: "Find dates and names")
↓
Generation (ChatGPT: "Write an email")
↓
Custom Training (Your own model: Specialized logic)
```

For MVP, pick something LEFT. More complex = more expensive + slower.

---

## Option 1: Rules-Based (Regex)

**What it is:** If-then statements written in code.

Example: "Extract anything matching the pattern MM/DD/YYYY"

**Pros:** Instant, costs $0, works great for structured patterns  
**Cons:** Only works for predictable formats, breaks on edge cases

**Cost:** $0-$500 (cloud server only)  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**Example tools:** Python regex, simple scripts

---

## Option 2: Use Pre-Trained Models (APIs)

**What it is:** Google, AWS, OpenAI have already trained models. You just call them.

Example: Google Document AI extracts text, dates, names from PDFs

**Pros:** Accurate, tested, simple to use, no ML knowledge needed  
**Cons:** Limited customization, monthly costs per use

**Cost:** $500-$2,000/month (usage-based)  
**Time:** 1-3 days to integrate  
**Example tools:** Google Document AI, ChatGPT API, AWS Textract, Azure Cognitive Services

---

## Option 3: Fine-Tune Open-Source (Advanced)

**What it is:** Take a pre-trained model (like BERT) and train it on your specific data.

**Pros:** Customized for your use case, cheap after setup  
**Cons:** Requires ML knowledge, takes 2-4 weeks

**Cost:** $1K-$5K  
**Time:** 2-4 weeks  
**Example tools:** Hugging Face, OpenAI fine-tuning, Vertex AI

---

## Option 4: Build Custom (Expert-Only)

**What it is:** Train a model from scratch on your data.

**Pros:** Fully customized, potential competitive advantage  
**Cons:** Expensive ($20K+), slow (months), needs ML expertise

**Cost:** $20K-$100K+  
**Time:** 2-6 months  
**Only do this if:** You have budget, time, and ML expertise

---

## The Decision Tree

```
START: Do you need custom logic (not offered by existing APIs)?
↓
NO → Use Option 2 (Buy API) ← MOST PEOPLE HERE
YES → Do you have $20K+ and 2 months? 
      ↓
      NO → Use Option 3 (Fine-tune open-source)
      YES → Use Option 4 (Build custom)

Is your task highly structured (dates, amounts, names)?
↓
YES → Try Option 1 (Regex) first - it's fast and free
NO → Try Option 2 (API) - proven, works for messy data
```

---

## Test Your Choice: The 1-Week Proof

Spend 1 week with your chosen method:

1. Set up the tool (API, open-source, or regex)
2. Run it on 100 real documents
3. Check: Does it meet your success metric (95% accuracy)?

If YES: You have your model. Move to Chapter 8.
If NO: Upgrade to the next option. Retry.

---

## Cost Comparison Table

| Option | 3-Month Cost | Build Time | ML Skill Needed | Accuracy |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1. Regex | $500 | 1-2 weeks | Low | 80-90% (structured) |
| 2. API | $1,500-$3,000 | 1-3 days | Low | 90-95% |
| 3. Fine-tune | $3,000-$7,000 | 2-4 weeks | Medium | 92-97% |
| 4. Custom | $20K+ | 2-6 months | High | 95%+ |

**For MVP: Pick Option 1 or 2. Fastest time to learning.**

---

## Mastery Challenge

For your MVP:

1. Choose your model option (1, 2, 3, or 4)
2. Spend 1 week testing it on 100 real documents
3. Measure: Does it hit your success metric?
4. Document: Cost, time, accuracy achieved

---

# <a name="chapter-8"></a>Chapter 8: Build Production-Ready

## The Core Idea

Your prototype (Chapter 7) works on YOUR laptop.

Now build something that works for 100+ customers, handles errors gracefully, and doesn't expose sensitive data.

This is where amateurs break. Here's how to do it right.

---

## The Three Layers (Revisited)

Remember from Chapter 6?

```
PRESENTATION: What users see (upload form, results page)
↓
APPLICATION: Your logic (API call to model, data processing)
↓
DATA: Database storing results
```

Now you have to build each properly.

---

## Layer 1: Presentation (Simple Upload Form)

Use a simple framework: **Streamlit** (free, Python-based, deploying to Streamlit Cloud is free).

Alternative: **Webflow** or **Bubble** (if you don't want to code).

**The form needs:**
- File upload
- Progress indicator ("Processing...")
- Results display
- Error handling ("Upload failed because...")
- Refund/feedback button

**Time:** 8-16 hours

---

## Layer 2: Application (Your Logic)

**Rule 1: Wrap your AI in an "abstraction layer"**

Don't call the API directly from your UI. Instead:

```
Create a function: def process_document(file):
  - Call your AI model/API
  - Handle errors
  - Return results

This way, if you swap models later, one line of code changes.
Not 100 places.
```

**Rule 2: Log everything**

Every error, every API call, every result. Why? Debugging and improving.

**Rule 3: Add retry logic**

If the API fails 50% of the time, retry 3 times automatically.

**Time:** 12-24 hours

---

## Layer 3: Data (Database)

Use a simple, managed database:

| Database | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Supabase** | Free (up to 100 users) | PostgreSQL without DevOps |
| **Firebase** | Free (up to 1GB) | Realtime updates |
| **Airtable** | Free (up to 1,200 records) | Non-technical teams |
| **Vercel DB** | $5/month | Serverless deployment |

**Store:** User uploads, results, feedback

**Don't store:** Sensitive data unless encrypted

**Time:** 4-8 hours setup

---

## Deployment (Where Your Code Actually Runs)

Options:

| Option | Cost | Setup Time | Best For |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Streamlit Cloud** | Free | 5 min | Python apps (MVP stage) |
| **Vercel** | Free (basic) | 10 min | Web apps (React, Next.js) |
| **Railway** | $5/month | 15 min | Any app (Flask, Python, etc.) |
| **Heroku** | $7/month | 10 min | Simple apps |
| **AWS/GCP** | $50-500/month | 1 day | Production scale |

**For MVP: Use Streamlit Cloud. Free, fast, sufficient.**

---

## The Beta Testing Plan

Before you tell customers, test with 10-20 power users:

**Week 1:** Internal testing (you and 2 co-founders)
- Try to break it
- Upload weird files
- Hit the API limit
- Document every error

**Week 2:** Beta users test (your "committed" customers)
- Track: How many completed uploads successfully?
- How many got errors?
- Did results match expectations?
- How long did it take?

**Success criteria:**
- 90%+ successful uploads
- Results accurate enough for their needs
- <1 minute end-to-end time

---

## The Checklist Before Launch

- [ ] Upload form works (tested 50+ times)
- [ ] Error messages are helpful (not "Error: null")
- [ ] Results are correct (tested on 100 real documents)
- [ ] API/model doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Database stores results securely
- [ ] Refund/feedback button works
- [ ] Server can handle 100 simultaneous users (load test)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set up (you know if it breaks)

---

## Mastery Challenge: Deploy Your MVP

1. Build the 3-layer system (Presentation, Application, Data)
2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (or similar)
3. Test with 10 beta users
4. Track: Success rate, accuracy, time-to-complete

---

# <a name="chapter-9"></a>Chapter 9: Make It Ethical

## The Core Idea

Your AI product will make decisions about people.

If you get it wrong, you hurt people (bias, discrimination, data leaks).

This chapter is about responsibility.

---

## The Three Ethical Risks

**1. BIAS:**

Your AI learns patterns from historical data. If that data is biased, your AI will be too.

**Example:** If you train on historical loan approvals (which were biased against women), your AI will be too.

**Fix:**
- Test your model on different groups (men, women, minorities)
- If accuracy differs >5%, retrain with balanced data
- Track this in your dashboard

**2. DATA PRIVACY:**

You're handling sensitive data (legal documents, medical records, etc.).

**Fix:**
- Encrypt data at rest (in the database)
- Use HTTPS for data in transit
- Delete data after X days (give users control)
- Get explicit consent: "I agree you'll process my documents"

**3. FAILURE MODES:**

What happens if your AI breaks or makes a bad prediction?

**Example:** Your document AI marks an important date wrong. Lawyer misses a deadline. Case fails.

**Fix:**
- Always show a human the results first
- Flag uncertain predictions: "Only 70% confident"
- Provide a "reject" button for humans
- Log all AI decisions (for audit trails)

---

## The Ethical Audit (Before You Launch)

Ask yourself:

```
1. Could this AI discriminate against any group? YES / NO
   If YES: What will I do to prevent it?

2. What sensitive data are we handling? (PII, medical, legal, financial?)
   How will we protect it?

3. What's the worst-case scenario if this AI fails?
   How will we recover?

4. Who can I ask to review this for bias? (Ethicist, lawyer, affected group)

5. If a customer complains, how will they reach me?
```

---

## The Responsibility Statement

Add this to your product:

```
"This AI is a tool to assist, not replace, human judgment. 
Results should be reviewed by a qualified professional before use.

If you think this AI made a mistake, click 'Report' to help us improve.

For concerns about bias or privacy, contact: [your email]
```

---

## Mastery Challenge: Ethics Audit

Before launching (Chapter 10), complete:

1. Bias test: Run your AI on 100 diverse documents. Compare accuracy across groups.
2. Privacy audit: Verify encrypted storage, consent forms, data deletion.
3. Failure plan: Document what happens if AI makes a critical error.
4. Get feedback: Have 1-2 people outside your team review for issues.

---

# <a name="chapter-10"></a>Chapter 10: Get Users to Pay

## The Core Idea

If people don't pay, they don't really value it.

This chapter teaches you how to get paid customers (not free users who disappear).

---

## Pricing Strategy

**Option 1: Per-Use Pricing**
- $0.10 per document processed
- Simple, aligns value with use
- Best for: Variable usage (some users process 10/month, others 1000/month)

**Option 2: Subscription (Monthly)**
- $99/month, unlimited documents
- Predictable revenue, easier accounting
- Best for: Customers who use it daily

**Option 3: Freemium (Hybrid)**
- Free: 10 documents/month
- Paid: Unlimited documents for $99/month
- Best for: Viral growth (free tier gets people hooked)

---

## Pricing Decision Tree

```
START: How do customers typically use your product?

HIGH VOLUME (many documents, daily):
→ Use SUBSCRIPTION ($99-499/month)

LOW VOLUME (few documents, occasional):
→ Use PER-USE ($0.05-0.50 per document)

UNCERTAIN/WANTS TO TRY:
→ Use FREEMIUM (10 free → upgrade to paid)
```

---

## Getting Your First Paying Customers

**Month 1: Direct Sales**

Don't wait for marketing. Go directly to the 10 people who said they'd pilot (Chapter 4).

Email:
```
Subject: Your pilot is ready

Hey [Name],

Remember we talked about how you spend 8 hours/week on transcript review?

We built it. It's ready for your pilot.

Try it free for 7 days: [link]

It works exactly like we discussed. Let me know what you think.

Questions? Reply here.

[Your name]
```

Track:
- How many click the link?
- How many sign up?
- How many convert to paying after 7 days?

**Target:** 5 customers by Month 1

---

## Payment Processing

Use **Stripe** (most common):

```
1. Go to stripe.com
2. Create account (5 minutes)
3. Integrate into your app (1 hour, copy-paste code)
4. Stripe handles: Payment security, taxes, fraud, refunds

Cost: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
```

---

## The Pricing Test

Before finalizing, test 3 price points on your beta users:

Email 10 beta users:

Group A: "Try free for 7 days, then $49/month"
Group B: "Try free for 7 days, then $99/month"
Group C: "Try free for 7 days, then $199/month"

Measure: Who converts at each price?

This tells you the optimal price.

---

## Metrics to Track

- Signups (how many people try it free?)
- Conversion (of those, how many pay?)
- Churn (of those paying, how many cancel?)
- LTV (Lifetime Value): How much will one customer pay before canceling?

```
Conversion Rate = Paying Customers / Total Signups
Example: 2 paying / 10 signups = 20% conversion

LTV = Monthly Revenue per Customer × 12 months
Example: $99/month = $1,188 LTV
```

---

## Mastery Challenge: Get 5 Paying Customers

1. Set up Stripe
2. Email your 10 committed users with the offer
3. Track signups and conversions
4. Adjust price based on conversion rate
5. Goal: 5 customers paying by Month 1

---

# <a name="chapter-11"></a>Chapter 11: Pitch to Investors (If You Want to Raise Money)

## The Core Idea

If you have 5-10 paying customers, investors will listen.

Here's how to tell your story so they care.

---

## The 10-Minute Pitch Outline

```
1. PROBLEM (1 minute)
   "Lawyers waste $100K/year per person reviewing transcripts manually"

2. SOLUTION (1 minute)
   "Our AI extracts key information in minutes, costing $99/month"

3. PROOF (2 minutes)
   "10 customers paying. Average NRR: 120% [show growth chart]"

4. TEAM (1 minute)
   "I built X before, have 5 years of experience in Y"

5. MARKET (1 minute)
   "5,000 law firms in the US = $600M TAM"

6. ASK (1 minute)
   "We're raising $500K to hire sales + engineers"

7. USE OF FUNDS (1 minute)
   "50% salaries, 30% marketing, 20% infrastructure"

8. VISION (1 minute)
   "In 3 years, we'll be the standard tool for legal document review"
```

---

## The Financials

Investors want to see:

```
REVENUE (monthly):
Month 1: $500 (5 customers × $99)
Month 2: $1,000 (10 customers)
Month 3: $2,500 (25 customers)
Month 12: $50,000 (500 customers)

BURN RATE (monthly spending):
Month 1: $2,000 (your salary, infrastructure)
Month 2: $2,000
Month 6: $15,000 (hired 2 people)

RUNWAY (how long until cash runs out):
You have $100K, burning $2,000/month = 50 months
```

---

## The Ask

Be specific:
- ❌ NOT: "We're raising money"
- ✅ YES: "We're raising $500K in a SAFE note at $5M valuation"

(SAFE = Simple Agreement for Future Equity, standard for early startups)

---

## Where to Find Investors

1. **Angel investors** (rich individuals): AngelList, local angel groups
2. **Small VCs** ($1-5M checks): Crunchbase, Y Combinator Directory
3. **Friends & family** (easiest first $100K): People who know you
4. **Accelerators** (Y Combinator, Techstars): Provide funding + mentorship

---

# <a name="chapter-12"></a>Chapter 12: Learn and Repeat

## The Core Idea

You've built, launched, and gotten paying customers.

Now: Learn what worked, what didn't, and do it all again.

---

## The Reflection Questions

**What went well?**
- Which validation step was most useful?
- Which customer interactions gave best insights?
- What surprised you (positive)?

**What went poorly?**
- Where did you waste time/money?
- Where were you wrong about the customer?
- What would you do differently?

---

## The Metrics That Matter

After 3 months, measure:

```
PRODUCT METRICS:
- Weekly Active Users: _____
- Accuracy of results: ___% (vs. manual review)
- Time saved per user: _____ hours

BUSINESS METRICS:
- Paying customers: _____
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): $_____
- Customer Churn: ____% (how many cancel per month?)

HEALTH METRICS:
- Customer Satisfaction (1-10 rating): _____
- NPS (Net Promoter Score): _____ (ask: "Would you recommend?")
- Support tickets per week: _____
```

---

## The Iteration Loop

Based on your metrics, pick ONE thing to improve:

**If churn is high:** Your customers are leaving. Why?
- Talk to 5 customers who canceled
- Ask: "What would make you stay?"
- Fix the biggest issue

**If acquisition is slow:** You're not getting new customers
- Test different messaging
- Try different channels (LinkedIn vs. industry forums)
- Increase sales effort

**If accuracy is low:** Your results aren't good enough
- Collect more training data
- Switch to a better AI model (Chapter 7)
- Add human review step

---

## The Product Roadmap

For next 12 months, plan:

```
QUARTER 1 (Months 1-3): PERFECT THE CORE
- Improve accuracy from 90% to 95%
- Get customer satisfaction to 9/10
- Reach 20 paying customers

QUARTER 2 (Months 4-6): SCALE ACQUISITION
- Hire a part-time salesperson
- Double customers to 40
- Improve NPS to 50+

QUARTER 3 (Months 7-9): ADD FEATURES
- Add export to Word (customer request #1)
- Add audit trail (customer request #2)
- Maintain 40+ customers

QUARTER 4 (Months 10-12): PLAN FOR GROWTH
- Decide: Hire team? Raise money? Sell company?
- Plan next product iteration
```

---

## When to Pivot

If after 3 months you have:
- <3 paying customers
- <50% NPS
- High churn (>30% monthly)

Something is wrong. Consider:

1. **Pivot the product:** Build what customers actually ask for (not what you thought they needed)
2. **Pivot the market:** Same product, sell to different industry
3. **Pivot the business model:** Change from subscription to per-use, or vice versa
4. **Kill it:** The market isn't ready. Pick a new problem (go back to Chapter 2)

---

## Mastery Challenge: Your 12-Month Plan

Create a 1-page document:

1. **3-month metrics:** Where are we now?
2. **12-month target:** Where do we want to be?
3. **Next 10 priorities:** What will we work on, in order?
4. **Pivot triggers:** When would we change direction?
5. **Success criteria:** How do we know we've won?

---

# GLOSSARY

**A/B Testing:** Testing two versions of something to see which works better. Example: Email A vs Email B, which gets more replies?

**API:** Application Programming Interface. A tool that lets you use someone else's software. Example: Google Maps API lets you use Google's maps in your app.

**Bias (AI):** When an AI system makes unfair decisions based on patterns in its training data. Example: An AI trained on historical hiring decisions that were biased against women.

**Bootstrap:** Building a company with your own money or revenue, without outside investment.

**Burn Rate:** How much money you spend per month.

**Churn:** Customers who stop using your product. If you have 10 customers and 1 leaves, that's 10% churn.

**Commit/Commitment Signal:** When a customer takes action (not just saying nice things). Example: Agrees to a pilot, introduces you to their boss, or enters payment info.

**Data Availability:** How easy is it to get the data you need? Proprietary data is hard. Public data is easy.

**Deploy:** Putting your code "live" on a server so customers can use it.

**Drill-Down:** Looking at specific details. Example: "Our AI accuracy is 95%" (broad), drilling down: "95% on clear transcripts, 80% on audio transcripts with background noise."

**Falsifiable:** Can be proven false. Example: "This will help lawyers" is vague. "This will reduce review time by 80%" is falsifiable (you can measure it).

**Founder:** The person starting the company.

**Freemium:** A business model where basic features are free, advanced features are paid. Example: 10 free uploads/month, then $99/month for unlimited.

**Impact:** The real-world effect. Example: "Impact: Lawyers save 8 hours per week."

**Iteration:** Repeating a process with improvements. Example: Build → Test → Get feedback → Build better version → repeat.

**LTV (Lifetime Value):** How much money one customer will spend, total, before leaving. Example: Customer pays $99/month for 12 months = $1,188 LTV.

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** How much predictable revenue you make every month. Example: 10 customers × $99/month = $990 MRR.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** The simplest version of your product that proves your idea works.

**NPS (Net Promoter Score):** How likely customers are to recommend you. Scale 0-10. If most say 9-10, that's good.

**Pain Point:** A problem that bothers someone. Example: "I waste 8 hours per week on this."

**Persona:** A description of your ideal customer. Example: "Sarah, 35, litigation paralegal at a 100-person law firm, frustrated with manual review."

**Pivot:** Changing strategy based on learning. Example: Started selling to lawyers, pivoted to selling to paralegals (easier to convince).

**Prototype:** An early, simple version of your product. Not perfect, but works.

**Retention:** Customers who stay. Opposite of churn. Example: 95% retention means 95% of customers stay, 5% leave.

**Runway:** How many months until you run out of money. Example: $50K cash / $2K burn rate per month = 25 months runway.

**Validation:** Proof that your idea works. Example: 5 customers paying is validation that people want it.

**Willingness to Pay (WTP):** Whether someone is actually willing to spend money on your solution. Different from "That's a cool idea" (cheap talk) vs. "I'll pilot it for $99" (real signal).

---

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: I'm scared I'll waste 6 months building the wrong thing.**
A: That's why you do Chapters 1-5 FIRST. Total time: 6 weeks. You'll know if it's wrong before investing months. Way better than building first and learning later.

**Q: Should I raise money?**
A: No. Not yet. Get 10 paying customers first. Then you're desirable to investors. Raising money now (without traction) means giving away 30-50% of your company for $100K. Wait until you have leverage.

**Q: My idea is too complex for this guide.**
A: Most aren't. Break it into smaller pieces. What's the ONE thing you're proving in the first 3 months? Focus there.

**Q: I'm not technical. Can I do this?**
A: Yes. Use APIs (Chapter 7: Buy option). Don't build from scratch. Use no-code tools (Zapier, Make, Airtable). Non-technical founders have won before (you don't need to code the first version).

**Q: My customers don't want to talk to me (Chapter 4).**
A: You're probably not their target customer. Or your outreach is too pushy. Try: "I'm curious about your workflow. Can I buy you coffee and ask 10 minutes of questions?" Works better than "Can you help me validate my startup idea?"

**Q: I'm running out of time/money.**
A: Pick ONE thing to focus on. Cut everything else. What's the ONE metric that proves viability? Focus on that only.

**Q: How do I know when to stop and try something new?**
A: After 3 months:
- <3 paying customers? Something is wrong.
- Customers don't use it? Product sucks.
- Can't find customers? Market is wrong.
- You hate it? You're in the wrong industry.

Give yourself permission to quit and try something new. Most successful founders have quit many times.
